DO NOT under any circumstances fly in close to the cliff after take off if you are below the top of the cliff. Landing in the vacant land down the road to the North end of the ridge should only be attempted after discussing the hazards with a local flier. Beach landings are safer, but can still be tricky as it is a narrow beach with turbulence at the base of the near vertical cliff. The Monument site can be beautifully smooth when blowing 14-18 kts and straight on, but we have seen more near serious accidents here than possibly any other Victorian site. The takeoff for paragliders is VERY tricky."

Set up over the back left hand corner (SW corner) of the vineyard and land between the dam and shoulder. If you think you are going to over shoot, an option would be to turn up the spine and land up hill, possibly light tail wind.\r\n\r\nWest landing: The main West LZ is across the road from the West take-off (on the north side of the road). It is not hard to reach, unless you are low. This is a long flat paddock 'between the river and the road', (across the road to the right of the homestead). This paddock now has groups of saplings (surrounded by circular bared wire fences) planted within it, and may have horses (ponyâ€™s). Landings are still possible but judgement and correct technique is required. The Bomb-Out (this should only be used for Emergencies) is to the right of the homestead, there is a dam in a gully, set up over it and land across the gully, or on to the uphill slope (be careful as this will be across the slope).\r\n\r\nTop landings: Are available behind the tower near the north launch, and in the valley behind the west launch. The following is strictly a guide, pilots must appreciate that turbulence increases expediential as the wind strength increases. 18 knots is said to be the limit. There will be a band of rotor to go through at about 130ft above, this should subside at about 80ft to 70ft, but be careful & ready. From the air you must access the current conditions and choose the sweet spot. If uncertain take the less convenient but conservative (SAFE) option and choose one of the bottom landing areas."

There\r\nis a sandy beach out at the point on which you can also land, however there is some \r\ncompression around the point.\r\nTop landing is relatively easy, however do NOT drift too far back as the rearwards sloping nature\r\nof the land means that some rotor is present behind the launch.

This is extremely dangerous for hang-gliders in winds above 18mph. \r\nhang-gliders should use the Kingston top landing fields but should always be \r\nprepared to be dropped 20 ft or more during approach. Land well back. \r\nParagliders should ideally land within 50m of the wall behind the stile.  \r\nToward Swyre Head it is possible to top land in most fields if you find the wind \r\nis dying on you. Beware, as you will almost certainly experience some degree \r\nof rotor. Only use this option in emergencies. \r\nAvoid landing in any cropped field or where animals are present.  \r\nDon't top land behind the rising ground to the west, due to rotor. \r\nBottom \r\nLanding \r\nThe bottom landing field A slopes and can be difficult to get into on a modem \r\nhang glider. \r\nBeware of the power lines. \r\nParagliders can side land anywhere but ensure you have an into-wind beat and \r\nwatch out for badger sets etc. The bottom landing is directly out in front of \r\nlaunch for paragliders. \r\nSpecial \r\nRules \r\nThis site is normally closed for three days every fortnight during the pheasantshooting season (end October to end February). Dates are published in the \r\nWessex Club newsletter and on the club website. \r\nDo not climb on the dry stone wall. Only cross at the stile behind take-off. \r\nDo not over fly or top land in fields A and B when there are sheep in them. \r\nAvoid flying over Smedmore House (see map) as the occupants are sensitive \r\nabout their privacy. \r\nRidge Runs, \r\nXC \r\nThis site can be very thermic but, being close to the sea, height gains of more \r\nthan 1,000ft ATO are uncommon. It is possible to drop onto the Purbeck Hills \r\nand run down to Swanage or from the Purbeck Ridge drop back toward \r\nStudland. Be aware of Poole Harbour and Bournemouth ATZ.  \r\nFrom Swyre Head it is possible to fly out onto the sea cliffs and west toward \r\nthe tower or east onto St. Aldhelmâ€™s Head. Both these adventures are quite \r\ntechnical and should not be undertaken without some thought. Bottom landing \r\nbeneath the cliffs is very limited and changes in cliff angle along many \r\nstretches of the cliff will produce areas of sink. \r\nFlying \r\nGenerally \r\nDespite the size of this site, it can become busy especially on light wind days \r\nwhen separation is poor. Some pleasant evenings can also be had on this site \r\nduring the summer and sea breeze works well here. On rough days it can be a \r\ngood place to practice active flying."

As of November 2011 the stolen windsock is back on landing site again and makes the life easier.\r\nJust case if it is missing again - observe the smoke and other signs in the valley. Normally during the day the wind is from east and just before sunset (1-2hrs) turns from west. If still in doubts, better land towards the west, even with light tailwind, as the field has a slight slope which makes the westward landings shorter."

The landing area has a wide parking lot. Bars and restaurants just a few meters away.\n\nIt gives the opportunity to land approaching from all four directions: north, south, east and west.\n\nHowever, there are a railway line and an electric power line on both sides of the landing area, It is recommended to pay particular attention to the altitude disposal and landing stages, avoiding potentially dangerous maneuvers. It worth remarking that the landing area sizes allow safe landings for everyone.\n\nSan Giuliano Terme area offers several fields that can be used as emergency landing. Please stay out of the private fields and, in case of an off-field landing, move away as quickly as possible without causing damages."

Landing on the beach either near the parking area or closer to the antenna is a good option although you will need to make a crosswind final with a very short turn into the wind right before touchdown.\r\n\r\nIf you leave the mountain within 100 feet of launch, you should have no problem making it to the parking area LZ. If you scratch down lower then a bailout beach landing will be required with a five minute walk back to the parking area."

The dune area is not flat, so take care.\n\nTake extra care in high season (December-February) when the campground is full. Always land with ample clearance of any tents, caravans, trees, and people. Remember; not everybody thinks we are in full control, so just stay away to avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nWhen in doubt, land on the beach. It's only a 150 meter walk back to the campground where you can pack your wing on the grass.\n\nTop landing is possible, but for expert pilots only:\n\nWhen the wind direction is N - NNW; fly to the very end of the ridge, towards the swimming pool. Turn and fly towards the back ridge of the take-off (your approach to the take-off is from the west). If too low (at any time); bail out and fly to the front of the hill to try again. If too high, make figure-8 turns above the back (S) ridge of the take-off until you are low enough to top-land into wind. Turbulence in this wind direction is minimal, as long as you don't go too far back (never cross the fence that runs along the walking path south of the take-off)\n\nWhen the wind is coming more from the WNW - NW; from the spur (just before the bowl), fly straight out towards the ocean. Keep looking back towards the hill and turn back until you are at the right height to fly over the highest tree on the ridge with a meter or so (your approach to the take-off is from the NE). Once you are over the tree on the ridge, it will get quite turbulent for a bit until you connect with the back of the take-off. If you are too high (you normally are); make figure-8's until you are low enough to land into wind on the top. \n\nThis latter option is the more turbulent route, but you can't come in from the west anymore because you will be flying with the wind towards the take-off at too high speed to make a safe top-landing."

We must land in this river delta area and not on the grassy State Park property. Please contact the ECPC before flying from Mt. Howard to arrange paperwork, site intro, and a time when club members are available. \n\n· This Delta area changes throughout the season, and from year to year. Please plan your flying trips to Mt. Howard accordingly. Contact the local pilots for updates on the delta landing, as it typically doesn’t become large enough for P-4 pilots until mid August. The river normally reaches full volume during the snow melt and spring runoff (Mid June-Mid July). Take high precaution when landing next to the swollen river at this time, as the only possible landing area is very small, rocky, brushy, and surrounded by tall trees!  The swift water could be very dangerous if a wing or a person falls into it!  Usually starting in may, the spring runoff will start to fill the lake as water is held behind the 27-foot tall irrigation dam located at the lake outlet. The lake will continue to fill for most of May, June, and early July until irrigation demands exceed spring runoff flows. Maximum capacity (highest water level) during normal years is around July 15th. After that point, the lake will continue to drop until a huge landing area is exposed by the end of September. \n\n· Landing a hang glider here is normally not recommended. \n\n· All pilots are advised to walk through the landing zone and become familiar with the area. Remember, landing zones always seem large from the ground and much smaller from the air!  Most visiting pilots overshoot their landings due to the thinner air and light wind. \n\n· When the lake is at a higher level (normally mid June-mid July) paraglider landings are not recommended at the lake as the landing area becomes restricted to a very small area with tall trees and a fast flowing river as hazards. Not until August does this landing area normally become easier (not requiring advanced maneuvering skills). It is advised that the river delta landing area be restricted to advanced P4 pilots until mid August when water levels drop and landing becomes more forgiving.\n\n· Do not land on State Park Property! The Wallowa Lake State Park has warned paraglider pilots not to land west of the river delta as it is not an appropriate activity for the park. Please respect the State Park requests and only land in the river delta area!  If the lake is high and the delta landing is too small, go land in the cow pasture or on the east moraine."

The main landing zone is not visible from launch due to another mountain obstructing the view. It is about 3000ft lower than launch located about 4 miles northeast just off of Route 8 at The Range. The Range is a golf driving range which also has miniature golf and batting cages. Before landing and still about 500ft above the LZ, yell down to let everyone know you are about to land. They will stop hitting golf balls to allow you room to land. Try to land off to the side if possible. If you need to land in the middle of the field, then do so and put safety first. As soon as you land, pick up your glider and carry it off to the side quickly so The Range customers can go back to hitting their golf balls. You can break down and fold up your glider under the building. The Range does sell cold soda and ice cream."

In this case I would recommend killing your glider with a 90 degree turn to get it to all lay down in one clean line.\r\n\r\nCould be interesting to fly back over the ridge and land where the camping is, but I imagine the rotor is something nasty and there is lots of broken glass around.
